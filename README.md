# LSN_exercises_delivery

Each exercise (code + jupyter notebook) is in its own folder; to compile it, it is sufficient to run ```make``` in every folder. 

For some exercises, pre-computed data are provided: in this case, each notebook has a ```FORCE_NEW_RUN``` boolean variable, which controls whether to keep existing data or force a new run.

> :warning: A working ``ipympl``` module installation for JupyterLab may be required to run exercises 8 and 12.
